## **Express.js + TypeScript Documentation**

### a. **What is Express.js?**
Express.js is a lightweight, unopinionated Node.js framework for building server-side applications. It abstracts away the complexity of setting up a server with HTTP, streamlining the process of handling routing, middleware, and HTTP requests.

### b. **Why Express.js and not Node.js?**
Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run on the server, but lacks built-in features for routing, request handling, and middleware. Express.js builds on Node.js, providing:
- **Simplicity**: Easy to use with minimal setup.
- **Middleware support**: Enable adding custom logic to requests at various stages.
- **Routing**: Simplified handling of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

### c. **What Can Express.js Do?**
- Serve **static files** like HTML, CSS, and images.
- Build **RESTful APIs**.
- Handle **middleware** for tasks like authentication, logging, and error handling.
- Integrate with **templating engines** (e.g., EJS, Pug) for dynamic web pages.
- Support real-time applications with WebSockets or libraries like **Socket.io**.
